 *
 * Given an m x n matrix of non-negative integers representing the height of
 * each unit cell in a continent, the "Pacific ocean" touches the left and top
 * edges of the matrix and the "Atlantic ocean" touches the right and bottom
 * edges.
 * 
 * Water can only flow in four directions (up, down, left, or right) from a
 * cell to another one with height equal or lower.
 * 
 * Find the list of grid coordinates where water can flow to both the Pacific
 * and Atlantic ocean.
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * The order of returned grid coordinates does not matter.
 * Both m and n are less than 150.
 * 
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Given the following 5x5 matrix:
 * 
 * ⁠ Pacific ~   ~   ~   ~   ~ 
 * ⁠      ~  1   2   2   3  (5) *
 * ⁠      ~  3   2   3  (4) (4) *
 * ⁠      ~  2   4  (5)  3   1  *
 * ⁠      ~ (6) (7)  1   4   5  *
 * ⁠      ~ (5)  1   1   2   4  *
 * ⁠         *   *   *   *   * Atlantic
 * 
 * Return:
 * 
 * [[0, 4], [1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 2], [3, 0], [3, 1], [4, 0]] (positions with
 * parentheses in above matrix).
